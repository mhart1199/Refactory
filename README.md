* I fixed the few bugs I saw which included missing parenthesis on certain fonts to allow them to be applied.

* I also resized the images in each layer to make the content more clear. I did this by adding a img description in the style.css.
  * I adjusted text sizes and direction in the style.css to correlate to image given.


  * Finally I fixed the destination of the link by adding the class name into the code to correlate the link to the section on the page.
